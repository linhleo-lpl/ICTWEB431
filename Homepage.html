    <center>The Vietnamese has a famous folk poems meaning that “In the pond, nothing’s more beautiful than lotus, the flower of the dawn”.
    The elegance of the lotus is often cited in the Vietnamese folk songs and poems.<br>
    To the Vietnamese, lotus is known as an exquisite flower, symbolizes the purity, serenity, commitment and optimism 
    of the future as it is the flower which grows in muddy water and rises above the surface to bloom with remarkable beauty.
    At night, the flower closes and sinks under water.<br>
    It rises and opens again at dawn.
    How it blossoms and recedes at certain times of the day makes the flower remain untouched by impurity.
    Thus, the lotus symbolizes the purity of heart and mind. <br>
    And just like the lotus, Vietnam has a strong affinity with the water.
    From history to present, Vietnamese farmers working on the paddy fields while fishermen make livelihood from the rivers and streams.<br> 
    Vietnamese civilization sprung out of the Red River delta,<br> where wet-rice cultivation along with fishing and rice planting was the mainstay of living.
